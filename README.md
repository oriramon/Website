1. In order to run my website you can either double-click the index.html file or follow this link: https://oriramonap.netlify.app

2. The input validation I perform in my "HW6script.js" file validates that the email form at the bottom of my website
cannot be submitted without a email, name, and message. There are obviously easier ways to validate this information
(such as adding "required"), but I wanted to practice formulating the validation myself and creating the manipulations
I want to my website.

3. This was my first time creating a website (an awesome project!) and I based my website off of a template. The input validation js file was written entirely by me and I made substantial changes to the original html and css templates. https://github.com/prabinmagar/photographer-portfolio-site-html-css.
